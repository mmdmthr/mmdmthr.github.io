		Hi, I’m Hari — a developer with a practical mindset, a love for learning, and a strong belief in building software that works for real people and solve real problems.
		I’ve worked on internal systems (dashboards, tools, and APIs).
		I’ve worked across professional teams, freelance projects, and small business initiatives.
		I believe the best software is the one people actually want to use — fast, simple, and built with empathy.
	</p>

	<h5>🧑‍💻 Professional Experience</h5>
	  <p>
		I’ve been part of teams that built full-stack MVPs, including a job portal and an accounting platform. 
		I’ve worked as a backend developer for a property tech platform, helping scale systems and improve reliability.
		I’ve also worked closely with non-technical teams to understand what they truly need, and translate that into software that supports their work — not slows them down.
		My development work spans both frontend and backend, with a focus on JavaScript and PHP.
	</p>

	<h5>🧠 What Drives Me</h5>
	<p>
		I’m a curious problem-solver. I’m not afraid to dive into something I don’t yet know, and I care about doing things properly — sometimes too much. 
		I’m learning to balance best practices with delivering fast, usable results. 
		People don’t always need the perfect app, but they do need something that works and grows with them.
	</p>
  
	<h5>📝 Writing</h5>
	<p>
		I write regularly about tech, work, and life on my blog. Sometimes I explore topics like digital minimalism and solo entrepreneurship.
